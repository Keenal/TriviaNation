# TriviaNation
A networked trivia game designed for use in classrooms. Class members are each in control of a nation on a map. The goal of the game is to increase the size of the nation by winning trival challenges and defeating other class members in contested territories. The focus is on gamifying learning and making it an enjoyable experience.
